# SecuredMessaging
Year 3 Dev Project

This is a Web API for my university development project.

The api provides a link to the Secured Messaging database which stored all sent and received messages between "brokers" and "bank A colleagues". 

This is a development project only and has no connections to any banks nor does it contain any real information.
